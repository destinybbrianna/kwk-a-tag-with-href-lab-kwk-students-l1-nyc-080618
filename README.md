 # Create an `<a>` Tag with an `href` Attribute

## Objectives

1. Code an `a`nchor tag that defines an HTML hyperlink.

## Introduction

Do you know the Wikipedia link game? [The game is
simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) - choose
any [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random), and click
the first link in the first paragraph of the page (ignoring pronunciation
links). 97% of the time, if you click long enough, you'll end up at
[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).  

Links, (short for _hyperlink_) are what makes up the core of _hyper_ in _HyperText_ Markup
Language. They allow the Google search engine to understand how web pages are
related. Without them, we'd just have a bunch of stand alone pages of boring
text making up the internet.

Let's practice making these _link_ things. 

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` in your text editor.
* Add an `a` tag with the inner text of `Kode with Klossy` anywhere in the file.
* Set the `href` attribute of your new link element to `https://www.kodewithklossy.com/`.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file
before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error messages
that you can use to debug your code — read them closely for hints!

## Viewing your work in the browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual layout in the browser. If you're using a local development environment, you can open the HTML file directly in your browser. If you're coding in the Learn IDE, check out this [Help Center article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-html-pages-in-the-learn-ide) that explains how to spin up and connect to a simple remote server.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the changes instantly.
